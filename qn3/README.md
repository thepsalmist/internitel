# Encryption and Hashing Algorithms

#### By Xavier Frankline.

## Description

This is a description of the common encryption and hashing algorithms used in computer science

## Encryption Algorithms

Types of encryption algorithms include Asymmetric encryption, Symmetric encryption, Deterministic encryption and Probabilistic encryption 

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption algorithms use only one secret key for both encryption and decryption. Symmetric encryption algorithms include Block ciphers and Stream ciphers. The former encrypts bits in discrete blocks while the latter encrypts data as it arrives and is not stored in memory.

### Examples of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
 
 1\. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - 

 2\. DES (Data Encryption Standard)

 3\. RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption algorithms uses two keys, a public keya and private key. The private key is kept secret. The sender encrypts data using a public key and the recipient uses a private key to access the data.

### Examples of Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms

  1\. RSA

  2\. Diffie_Helman

  3\. Elliptic-curve algorithm
  


## Hashing Algorithms

Hashing is often used together with encryption algorithms to maintain data integrity and security. Hashing is similar to encryption since the input data is hashed to produce randomized output data. However, unlike Encryption, hashing is a one way process.

Examples of hashing algorithms include 

  1\. MD5 - The MD5 algorithm encodes strings of information into a 128-bit fingerprint

  2\. SHA-2 - The SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm) is build from SHA-1, it was developed by the NSA. The alorithm uses 244,256,384 or 512 bits for configurations.

  3\. CRC32 - The Cyclical Redundancy Check is an error detection algorithm used to detect data corruption.
